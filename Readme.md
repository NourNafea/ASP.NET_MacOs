# ASP.NET_MacOs
## setting up the work environment
### Install Rider
###### Rider is made by the same company who does Resharper(JetBrains). Resharper is awesome and makes your life a lot easier when you're coding. It can also suggest better ways of doing things. It also works like a charm on Mac which is great for me who likes to work across my PC and Mac. 
###### Actually that's the best IDE to develop .NET application on MacOs (Apple silicon). However a lot of things that are easily accomplished in Visual Studio take a few more steps to initially setup in Rider. Entity Framework is one of them. Hopefully this will help someone else set it up or me when I need to do this again for my next project and forget üòÅ
###### First Go download the full version of Rider from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet)
###### Then you may install The UI for EntityFramework Corefrom here `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18147-entity-framework-core-ui`
